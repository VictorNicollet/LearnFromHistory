Lieutenant Bronsky woke up ten minutes later in the 
infirmary. By then, I had issued an all-encompassing 
gag order to prevent anyone else from learning about 
our situation. Gag orders seldom end well, 
especially in Horror-class scenarios, but I needed 
some time to think of a way out.

"Are you feeling all right, weakling ?"

"Yes, captain."

The infirmary looked like a morgue. I liked that. 
The crew didn't. Bronsky sat motionless on the edge 
of the steel bed. For a second, I thought it looked 
like a chopping board, and wished I had a cleaver 
handy. But this was no time for letting off steam. 

"Are you happy with what you have done ?"

"No, captain."

"Are you willing to take the blame for what 
happened ?"

He looked desperate, but the mushroom cloud over 
his life seemed to have a silver lining.

"If I may, sir, I would very much enjoy to bring
you down with me."

"You were the one who punched the button in front
of the wrong planet !"

"You were the one in charge. Why did you not stop 
me ?"

"I trusted you !"

"Trust ? No. You predicted that I would not create 
too many problems for you, and acted accordingly."

I knew Bronsky was a smart man. I had read his 
file many times already. But it still felt 
surprising to see him act like one. If our 
higher-ups learned that our bombs killed members 
of an Imperial Guild, it would not matter who gave 
the order : every single crew member would be 
executed. 

"I want to save our lives." I whispered.

"How ?"

"We should say someone else did it."

"But who ?"

"I was thinking of the sentients on Sol IV. Forge 
the report to make them look dangerous, then go 
along with the genocide to wipe out any evidence to
the contrary."

"How would that explain the Singularity warhead 
craters ? Any idiot would notice that."

"Watch your mouth, Bronsky. Even though we are both 
dead men walking, I am still your captain." 

"Yes, sir. I apologize."

He did not look apologetic at all. His eyebrows 
were flexed, his teeth clenched, and his gaze 
wandered off somewhere above my right shoulder. I 
could not tell whether he was angry, or thinking 
hard about our life-and-death situation.

The lights flickered. I had asked the engineers to 
make the lights flicker every so often. It added 
to the atmosphere. 

"If I may, captain..."

"Please, speak your mind. Politely."

"There is no doubt that our weapons killed the 
Guild members. Any decent investigator would 
figure that out. Our only chance is to make it 
look like we had to bomb Sol III even though 
there were Guild members there."

"Are you thinking of a Puppetteer-class scenario ?"

He nodded. It made sense, in a way : if we could 
somehow prove that the Guild expedition was 
mind-controlled by aliens, then executing them 
from orbit would be following the protocol to the 
letter. 

"What kind of scenario did you have in mind ?"

"Something noticeable from orbit during the surface 
inspection. An infestation scenario would be best, 
like [Starcraft](is a video game by Blizzard) or 
[Half-Life](is a video game by Valve), but we'd 
need an infested body as proof, and have no means 
to create one."

"What about a neural interface glitch ? All Guild 
members wear brain coprocessors." 

"How is that noticeable from orbit ?"

I refused to admit a fatal flaw in my plan. Not in 
front of him. Time to answer a question with 
another question :

"Why would we run a surface inspection on a planet 
being terraformed by the Guild, anyway ? The 
obvious course of action would be to just contact 
them..."

"Which would give the rogue AI a vector to attack 
us as well, only we don't use neural interfaces, so 
it would only be able to take down our computer 
systems !"

"Yes ! And wipe our logs as well, along with any 
evidence !" 

"What about the weapon usage logs ? The orbital 
bombardment would necessary be a retaliation, so it 
would happen after the log wipe."

"The protocol for a Puppetteer-class scenario 
requires sending a team to the surface after the 
execution strike. If we mess up, and bring an 
infected survivor on board, it would cause a second 
wipe."
